Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for Image Classification (MNIST / CIFAR-10)
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification tasks using popular datasets: MNIST (handwritten digits) and CIFAR-10 (color images with 10 classes). The goal is to build and train a CNN model to classify images and evaluate its performance.

Dataset
MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images, each representing a handwritten digit (0–9) with grayscale pixel values.

The images are 28x28 pixels in size.

CIFAR-10 Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.

It includes classes like airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, and truck.

Project Overview
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is implemented using Keras with TensorFlow as the backend. The model architecture consists of several convolutional layers, max-pooling layers, and fully connected layers, followed by a softmax layer for classification.

Model Architecture
Convolutional Layers: Convolutional layers apply filters to the input image to capture spatial features such as edges, textures, etc.

Pooling Layers: Max pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions and retain the most important features.

Fully Connected Layers: These layers are used to map the high-level features to final classification categories.

Output Layer: The output layer uses the softmax activation function to classify the image into one of the categories.

Tools and Libraries
Python: The primary programming language used for implementation.

TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning library used to create, train, and evaluate the CNN model.

NumPy/Pandas: Used for data handling and manipulation.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting results.

Installation
Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
Install dependencies:


pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the script:
After setting up the repository and installing the dependencies, you can run the training and evaluation scripts. For example:


python train_model.py
Usage
Preprocessing Data:

The data is first loaded and preprocessed, including normalization and reshaping.

For MNIST, the data is reshaped to match the input shape of the CNN model (28x28x1).

For CIFAR-10, the images are resized to 32x32x3 (RGB color images).

Training the Model:

The CNN model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

The model is trained for a set number of epochs and evaluated on the test data.

Evaluating Performance:

The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, and the results are plotted to visualize the training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs.

Example Code
Here’s a snippet of the code for building the CNN model using Keras:


from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense

# Define the model architecture
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(28, 28, 1)),  # MNIST input shape
    MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # For MNIST (10 classes)
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10)
Results
MNIST: After training, the model achieved X% accuracy on the test set.

CIFAR-10: The model achieved Y% accuracy on the test set.

The training curves for both datasets show that the model's accuracy improved over time and the loss decreased steadily.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how CNNs can be effectively used for image classification tasks. The MNIST dataset was a simple starting point, and CIFAR-10 provided a more challenging task. The model can be further optimized by experimenting with hyperparameters, adding more layers, or using techniques like data augmentation.
